Rice is the staple food of about 180 million people of Bangladesh. About 90% Bangladeshi eats rice as their daily food. It provides nearly 48% of rural employment and supplies about two-third of total calorie. Rice contributes one-sixth of the national income and one-half of the agricultural GDP in Bangladesh. Almost all of the 13 million farm families of the country cultivate rice. Rice is grown on about 10.5 million hectares which has remained over the past three decades. So, rice plays a vital role in the livelihood of the people of Bangladesh. But it is unfortunate that all the cultivated varieties of rice suffer from several diseases over its entire growth period. Diseases can affect both productivity and crop quality as well. Out of 31 rice diseases, 10 are considered as major diseases Among the diseases, bacterial leaf blight, brownspot, blast, tungro and sheath blight cause substantial loss to rice both in quality and quantity in the present ecosystem in Bangladesh. The detection of diseases is a quite hard task for farmers and experts with naked eyes. In modern agricultural practices, it is very important to manage diseases using highly efficient methods with minimum damage to the environment. So, we opt to develop an efficient CNN model for rice leaf diseases to provide the farmers an effective system to identify symptoms of various diseases by using captured images.
